            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I'm currently a mechanical design engineer with three years of experience 
            analyzing static structures, writing and reviewing technical reports, and collaborating
            on designs with senior engineers. Over the past year, though, I've have had a
            strong interest in web3 and blockchain development for Ethereum, and have spent most
            of my time outside of work learning a wide array of related topics as a result. 
            These include foundational blockchain and computer science courses, languages such as 
            Solidity and Javascript, going through web development tutorials and war-games like 
            Ethernauts, etc. All of this in hopes of landing a job in the space so I can spend more
            of my time contributing to the ecosystem!
